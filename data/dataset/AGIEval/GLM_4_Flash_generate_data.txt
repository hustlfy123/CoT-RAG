New Context: In a recent promotion round, Emily got a higher raise than David. Then, when Sarah, who was not initially included in the promotion round, negotiated with her superiors and got a higher raise than Jennifer, Emily's raise was still higher than Jennifer's.
New Questions:

Therefore, any assumption that suggests David's raise was higher than Sarah's or as high as the combined raises of both Sarah and Jennifer is not in line with the scenario.

New Questions with new contexts:

Context: The government is the primary instrument to ensure the welfare of its citizens and meet their basic needs. For this to happen, the government must be aware of the needs of its people and devise policies accordingly. A free flow of opinions and information can help the government understand the pulse of the people and make informed decisions. Hence, freedom of expression is crucial for a well-functioning society.

a. Given this viewpoint, which statement would not undermine the importance of free speech in ensuring the government meets people's needs?
    i. The people's needs are often irrational and unpredictable.
    ii. Government policies are designed to benefit the people without the need for feedback from them.
    iii. Free speech results in excessive noise and controversy, hindering the government's ability to act effectively.
    iv. While freedom of expression is vital, other societal factors like education and healthcare are more important in meeting people's needs.

Context: It is essential for a government to understand the needs of its citizens to ensure societal harmony and progress. To understand these needs, it must engage with its people and create avenues for them to express their viewpoints. Free speech is one such avenue that enables citizens to voice their demands and suggestions directly to the government. Therefore, promoting free speech is vital for a government that aims to serve its people effectively.

b. Considering this perspective, which statement does not weaken the argument that free speech is crucial for a government to understand and meet people's needs?
    i. Governments often understand the needs of their citizens even without hearing their voices directly.
    ii. Free speech can lead to political instability and social unrest, making it a risky tool for governments to rely on.
    iii. The best way for a government to meet its citizens' needs is through direct engagement and understanding, rather than relying on freedom of expression alone.
    iv. The modern media, rather than free speech, is the most effective way for citizens to communicate their demands to the government.

Context: In order to effectively serve its citizens, a government must have a clear understanding of their needs and desires. Free speech serves as a medium for citizens to express their viewpoints and demands, enabling the government to make informed decisions that reflect the will of the people. It is believed that promoting free speech is crucial for a government to understand and meet people's needs accurately and efficiently.

c. Which statement, if true, would not diminish the role of free speech in enabling the government to understand and fulfill its citizens' needs?
    i. Governments should not rely solely on freedom of expression but should also consider other factors like social surveys and feedback from stakeholders.
    ii. Free speech often leads to controversial topics that are not beneficial for societal harmony and progress.
    iii. The more citizens express their needs through free speech, the better equipped the government becomes to meet those needs accurately.
    iv. Governments can understand their citizens' needs even without allowing freedom of expression through formal channels like surveys or other structured feedback methods.

d. Given this emphasis on free speech as a means for citizens to communicate their needs to the government, which statement does not undermine this argument?
    i. Some people misuse their freedom of expression to spread false information and propaganda, hurting societal harmony and undermining trust in the government.
    ii. Free speech alone cannot create a perfect society or solve all societal problems; it merely provides a platform for expression.
    iii. Citizens who are unaware of their rights or have limited knowledge of social issues struggle to express their demands effectively through free speech channels. 
    iv (Yet,) sometimes, it is precisely the restrictions on free speech that help maintain social harmony and prevent chaos."

a. The salesperson told customers that the cooling performance of a refrigerator is mainly determined by the quality of its compressor, and the Penguin refrigerator uses the same high-quality compressor as the Polar Bear refrigerator. If the quality of the compressor is proven to be a major factor in determining the cooling performance of a refrigerator, could this reasonably lead to the salesperson's conclusion that buying a Penguin refrigerator instead of a Polar Bear refrigerator would provide the same cooling effect?

b. The salesperson highlighted that the Penguin refrigerator has fewer costs associated with its production and distribution compared to the Polar Bear refrigerator. If it is proven that the cost of production and distribution impacts the final price of a refrigerator, could this reasonably explain why a customer would choose to buy a Penguin refrigerator instead of a Polar Bear refrigerator, while still getting the same cooling effect?

c. The salesperson emphasized that the Penguin refrigerator has a similar cooling performance to the Polar Bear refrigerator despite being priced lower. If it is proven that refrigerators with similar cooling performance often have comparable component specifications, including the compressor, could this reasonably support the salesperson's argument?

d. The salesperson mentioned in his pitch that both the Penguin and Polar Bear refrigerators use high-quality compressors. If it is proven that all refrigerators with high-quality compressors provide consistent cooling performance, regardless of brand or price, could this reasonably justify the salesperson's claim that buying a Penguin refrigerator would yield the same cooling effect as a Polar Bear refrigerator?

Thus, this is a multiple-choice question with valid options (A) B and (D).
