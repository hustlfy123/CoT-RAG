Original Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?

New Questions:
a. **Context:** Research has shown that certain fish species grow larger in deeper waters where light penetration is limited. These fish have adapted to their environment, where higher pressure and lower light influence their development. Given these conditions, it can be inferred that environmental factors play a significant role in determining the size of aquatic life.  
   **Question:** Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?

b. **Context:** Studies indicate that mammals living in colder climates tend to grow larger than their relatives in warmer regions. This phenomenon, known as Bergmann's Rule, suggests that body size varies with temperature, impacting thermal regulation and survival. High latitude species are generally larger.  
   **Question:** Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?

c. **Context:** Ecological research has demonstrated that trees can grow to massive sizes in nutrient-rich soil, while those in poorer soils remain smaller.

   Options: ['(A) Pesticide use harms butterflies more than it does bees.', '(B) Even with the drop in butterfly numbers and the surge in bee populations, there are still more butterflies in the garden than bees.', '(C) Prior to the increase in bees, butterfly numbers had already started to decrease.', '(D) Butterflies primarily feed on nectar from flowers, and bees also rely on the same flowers for food.']

d. Context: The number of salmon in the river has significantly decreased, while the population of otters has increased at a similar rate.

   Question: Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the above argument?  
   Options: ['(A) Pollution in the river affects salmon survival more than it affects otters.', '(B) Although salmon numbers have declined significantly and otter numbers have increased, there are still more salmon in the river than otters.', '(C) Before the number of otters rose, salmon populations had already been dropping.', '(D) Otters primarily feed on smaller fish, which are also a key food source for salmon.']
