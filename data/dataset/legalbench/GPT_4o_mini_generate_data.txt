1. **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINTS**
   Netflix respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.

   **RISK OF LOSS**
   All purchases of subscription services from Netflix are made pursuant to a service contract. This means that the risk of loss and access to such services pass to you upon our activation of the account.

   **RETURNS, REFUNDS AND ACCESS**
   Netflix does not retain control of unused subscription periods once the payment is processed. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a cancellation of the service. In this situation, Netflix does not retain access to the refunded subscription.

   **SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS**
   Netflix attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Netflix does not warrant that service descriptions or other content of any Netflix service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a service offered by Netflix itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to cancel it in accordance with our cancellation policy.

   **PRICING**
   "List Price" means the suggested retail price of a subscription service as provided by Netflix. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on Netflix and other services. Certain subscription tiers may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history on Netflix.
   With respect to subscriptions sold by Netflix, we cannot confirm the price of a subscription until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of subscriptions in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of a subscription sold by Netflix is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before activating the account or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other services may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced subscription.
   We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the activation process.

b. "Does Twitter guarantee that it won't provide advertisers with information that could pinpoint my exact identity?"
c. "Does LinkedIn commit to not sharing user data that allows employers to know precisely who applicants are?"
d. "Does Snapchat ensure that it does not disclose user information to advertisers in a manner that reveals their identities?" 

New Contract for Question a: "Instead of charging you for using Instagram and the various services we provide, by utilizing the Instagram Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can present advertisements that businesses and organizations have paid us to display on and off the Instagram Company Products. We utilize your personal information, such as details regarding your activity and interests, to present you with more relevant advertisements.

Protecting user privacy is a fundamental aspect of our ad system's design. This implies that we can show you pertinent and useful ads without disclosing your identity to advertisers. We do not sell your personal information. We enable advertisers to inform us of their business objectives and the type of audience they wish to target (for instance, individuals aged 18-35 who are interested in fitness). Accordingly, we display their ads to users who may be interested.

We also offer advertisers analytics regarding their advertisement performance to assist them in understanding user engagement with their content both on and off Instagram. For example, we provide generalized demographic and interest data to advertisers (such as that an ad was viewed by a male aged 30-40 living in New York and interested in technology) to help them comprehend their target audience better. We do not share information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address) unless you provide explicit permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads operate here.

We gather and utilize your personal data to provide the above-described services to you. For more details on how we collect and employ your data, please refer to our Data Policy. You have control over the types of ads and advertisers you encounter and the information we use to determine the ads you see. Learn more."

d. "Does LinkedIn pledge to refrain from supplying advertisers with any personal data that might lead to the identification of a specific member?"

Contract for New Questions:
1. Google Contract: Instead of paying to use Google services, by using Google's products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can display advertisements from businesses and organizations that pay us to promote their content on and off our platforms. We utilize your personal data, such as information regarding your interactions and preferences, to present advertisements that are more relevant to you.

Protecting our users' privacy is fundamental to our advertising system. Therefore, we can show you pertinent and helpful ads without disclosing your identity to advertisers. We do not sell your personal data. Advertisers can notify us about their objectives and the type of audience they wish to target (for instance, individuals aged 25-40 who enjoy cooking). We then display their ads to users who might find them interesting.

We also furnish advertisers with performance reports regarding their ads to assist them in understanding how users react to their content on and off Google. For example, we can inform advertisers that their ad was viewed by a male between the ages of 30 and 45 in San Francisco, who is interested in graphic design, without revealing any personally identifiable information. We do not disclose any information that directly identifies you unless you provide us with explicit consent.

2. Twitter Contract: In exchange for using Twitter's services, you agree that we will serve you ads from businesses and organizations that compensate us for promoting their content. Your personal information, including details about your behavior and interests, helps us show you advertisements tailored to your preferences.

Maintaining user privacy is essential to our advertising model. Thus, we can present you with targeted ads without revealing your identity to advertisers. We do not sell personal information. We can communicate advertisers' desired outcomes and the target user demographics (e.g., users aged 18-34 who are interested in fitness) and show their ads to likely interested users.

We also supply advertisers with general feedback about their ad performance to help them gauge user engagement with their content on and off Twitter. For example, we may report that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 20 and 30 who resides in New York and enjoys fashion, while still ensuring that we do not share identifiable information unless permitted by you.

3. Instagram Contract: By using Instagram, you agree to receive ads from companies and organizations that compensate us for promoting their products and services. To provide you with relevant ads, we utilize your personal data, such as your activity and interests.

We prioritize user privacy in our advertising practices, which allows us to show you useful ads without disclosing your identity to advertisers. We do not sell any of your personal data. Advertisers provide us guidance about their goals and intended audience (for instance, individuals in their 20s who love travel), and we deliver their ads to potentially interested users.

Additionally, we provide advertisers with insights on their ads' performance to help them understand user interaction with their content on Instagram. For example, we can share that their ad was reached by a male aged 28 living in Toronto who has shown interest in hiking, without revealing personal identifiers unless you give explicit approval.

4. LinkedIn Contract: By utilizing LinkedIn's products, you agree that we can feature advertisements from businesses that pay for such promotions. We use your personal data, including your professional preferences and activities, to show you advertisements that are pertinent to you.

We focus on safeguarding user privacy, which enables us to display relevant ads without revealing user identities to advertisers. We do not engage in selling your personal data. Advertisers can inform us of their marketing objectives and audience preferences (for example, professionals aged 30-45 working in IT) so we can deliver their content to suitable users.

We also provide advertisers with performance metrics on their ads to clarify how users engage with their messages on LinkedIn. For example, we may report to an advertiser that their ad reached a woman aged 32 in London who is interested in software development, ensuring that we do not disclose any information that directly identifies you unless you give explicit consent.

3. Limits on Liability
We strive to deliver the best Services possible and set forth clear guidelines for all users. Our Services are provided "as is," and we do not guarantee that they will always be safe, secure, or free of errors, or that they will function without interruptions or defects. To the extent allowed by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or influence the actions or remarks of users and others, and we are not liable for their actions or behavior (either online or offline) or any content shared (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable material). 

We recognize that unforeseen issues may occur with our Services. Therefore, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstances will we be responsible for lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or for consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising from or related to these Terms or the Services, even if we have been alerted to the potential of such damages.

4. Disputes
We aim to establish clear standards to minimize or ideally prevent disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, it is beneficial to clarify from the outset where resolution can occur and which laws will govern it. 

If you are a consumer, the laws of your country of residence will govern any claims, causes of action, or disputes arising from these Terms or the Services, and you may file your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the matter. In other scenarios, you agree that any claims must be exclusively directed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court situated in San Mateo County. You also consent to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts in relation to the litigation of such claims, and the laws of the State of California will apply to these Terms and any related claims, without consideration of conflict of law provisions.

**Fee-Based Services and Billing**

Unless otherwise specified in the additional terms that apply to the Services you are using, the terms in this Section 11 apply to you.

We offer products and subscriptions for a fee (fee-based Services). These fee-based Services are governed by the additional terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and these Terms. If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information, and you have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. Many fee-based Services require you to have, or register for, an account or identification method. If you are a specific type of customer (e.g., Dial-Up customer), please see additional terms.

The following important provisions apply to all of our fee-based services:

**Third-Party Products:** If the fee-based Service includes a third-party product, you agree that your purchase and use of the Service is also subject to the third party's terms of service and privacy policy, which you should read thoroughly before agreeing to them.

**Payments:** You represent that you are at least the minimum age required to enter into a legal agreement. You agree to pay us for any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes and fees. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account or any sub- or linked accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.

**Payment Methods:** You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information from prior purchases and provide you the option to use that information during a new purchase. You permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with the policies of any applicable card brands. We may, in some instances, continue charging a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors' or issuing bank's approval.

**Payment Terms:** We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account.

**Auto-Renewal:** We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the designated payment method you provided, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services.

**Fraud Protection:** We may take steps to verify the validity of your credit card information, including debiting amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and anti-fraud purposes.

**Free Trials:** We may offer you free trials to try a fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation. Unless otherwise stated, and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration.

**No Refunds:** All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service.

**Termination:** We may change, discontinue, or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service at any time by logging into your account.

**Change in Fees and Billing Method:** We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We will notify you of any price increase at least thirty days in advance.

**Delinquency:** After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment.

**90-Day Notice Period:** You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.

New Contracts:
**Amazon Returns and Cancellations Policy**

Sellers can establish policies that allow for certain modifications to automate replacements, returns, and refunds. For all new sellers listing products where returns are accepted, Amazon will apply a default policy that manages the return process automatically. Sellers have the option to revise or opt-out of their return preferences in their Seller Central settings. If sellers have configured their settings to automatically accept returns or exchanges, Amazon will provide a generated return shipping label to the buyer. You agree to adhere to our return policy guidelines.

When an item is returned, to process a refund for the buyer, you (as seller) authorize Amazon to request that any applicable funds be removed from your payment account, recorded on your billing statement, or applied to your payment method on file.

The responsibility for return shipping costs for an item misrepresented in its description falls on the seller.

You (as seller) grant Amazon permission to charge the cost of the return shipping label to your invoice when:

- An Amazon-generated return shipping label is utilized, and you are accountable for the costs;
- Returns have been set to automate;
- You neglect to facilitate a return shipping label for your buyer, resulting in the use of an Amazon-generated shipping label; and/or
- A transaction is canceled, and to issue a refund, you (as seller) authorize Amazon to request reimbursement from your payment account.

**Fiverr Cancellation and Refund Policy**

Service providers can set their own guidelines regarding changes to cancellation policies and refunds. For new service providers, Fiverr will implement a standard cancellation policy that automates most processes. Service providers may alter their cancellation and refund preferences through the seller dashboard. In cases where cancellation requests are automatically accepted, Fiverr will manage communication with buyers regarding refunds. You agree to follow this cancellation policy framework.

When a service is canceled, if a refund is issued to the buyer, you (as seller) authorize Fiverr to take the refund amount from your payment account, which may appear on your invoices or be processed through your account.

Responsibility for refunding costs in cases of misleading service descriptions lies with the seller.

You (as seller) consent to Fiverr placing any incurred refund amounts on your invoice under circumstances where:

- A Fiverr-generated refund process is utilized, and you are accountable for the associated costs;
- Automated cancellation processes are in effect; 
- You fail to deliver a refund for a cancellation request, leading to a Fiverr-generated refund transaction; and/or
- A service is canceled requiring a refund, for which you (as seller) authorize Fiverr to seek recovery from your payment method.

### New Contracts Corresponding to New Questions

#### Contract for New Question a:
**Amazon Shipping Policy Modification**

Sellers on Amazon have the ability to set their own shipping policies for the products they offer. By default, Amazon provides a standard shipping procedure, but sellers can customize their shipping options according to their preferences. Sellers can change the shipping preferences in their account settings at any time. You agree to adhere to Amazon’s shipping guidelines.

When an item is shipped, Amazon may charge the seller for shipping fees, which will be deducted from their account balance. Additionally, if a seller fails to fulfill an order according to the specified shipping policy, they authorize Amazon to charge associated costs to their account. 

Amazon reserves the right to suspend or change the shipping policy in response to suspected misuse or violations of the seller’s agreements.

#### Contract for New Question b:
**Etsy Cancellation Policy Adjustment**

Etsy sellers are allowed to define their own cancellation policies for the products they sell. While Etsy provides baseline cancellation guidelines, sellers can modify these to better suit their business practices. Adjustments can be made through the seller's dashboard on Etsy. You must comply with Etsy's cancellation terms.

If a buyer requests a cancellation, and the seller has authorized such requests, Etsy will initiate the process according to the seller's established policies. Failure to adhere to the cancellation policy may result in fee deductions from the seller's account. 

Etsy retains the authority to modify cancellation policies if there are indications of policy abuse or seller misconduct.

#### Contract for New Question c:
**Shopify Refund Policy Customization**

Shopify store owners have the flexibility to set their own refund policies for the products they sell. By default, Shopify provides guidance on refund procedures; however, sellers are free to tailor these to fit their specific business requirements. Changes can be made in the settings section of their Shopify account. You must comply with Shopify's refund guidelines.

In the event of a refund, Shopify may represent the seller in processing the refund, which may involve withdrawing the refund amount directly from the seller’s account. Sellers are responsible for adhering to their specified refund policy, and unauthorized refunds may incur additional charges.

Shopify reserves the right to review and alter refund policies in response to incidents of misuse or violations by sellers.

#### Contract for New Question d:
**Walmart Exchange Policy Modification**

Sellers on Walmart Marketplace can customize their exchange policies for items listed on the platform. While Walmart has standard exchange guidelines in place, sellers have the discretion to amend these policies to better align with their operational philosophies. Modifications can be made in the seller's portal on Walmart's website. You agree to comply with Walmart’s policies regarding exchanges.

When a buyer initiates an exchange request, Walmart will facilitate the process according to the seller’s established policy. If a seller has not honored their exchange terms, Walmart may adjust fees on the seller's account balance accordingly.

Walmart holds the right to revise the exchange policies should there be indications of policy abuse or attempts to undermine established seller agreements.

Contracts for New Questions:

a. Contract: The OpenStreetMap Foundation is committed to supporting the growth and distribution of open geographic data. Our role is to host a platform that allows users to collaboratively edit map entries for public use. However, we act solely as a hosting service and do not engage in editorial activities regarding the content contributed by users. It is important to understand the following aspects of our relationship:
1. We do not edit map entries: All content hosted on OpenStreetMap is created by users, and we do not modify or oversee those contributions. This means we typically do not monitor map content and do not take responsibility for its accuracy or reliability.
2. Contributors are responsible for their contributions: Users are legally accountable for the edits made on OpenStreetMap, and should ensure they do not contribute content that may lead to legal issues under applicable laws, including relevant laws of their respective countries.

Our role is to provide resources and tools that enable users to understand and apply licenses to their content. It is crucial to be aware of the following aspects of our engagement:
1. We do not edit licensed content: Creative Commons does not oversee or modify content that users apply licenses to. Each user holds responsibility for their contributions and the appropriate usage of licenses.
2. Users must maintain legal responsibility: Contributors to Creative Commons licenses must ensure their actions comply with legal standards, as we cannot provide immunity or legal guarantees regarding the use of licensed works.

c. Contract: The Internet Archive is dedicated to building an enduring library of digital content for public access. We provide tools and a platform for users to view and access archived websites. Our principles dictate the following:

2. A declaration on the discussion page accompanying any paid contributions, indicating compensation received.
3. A note in the edit summary that explains the nature of your compensation or sponsorship related to the content you modify or create.

c. "Does one particular license cover all visual and audio materials I donate to Creative Commons projects?"
d. "Is there a standard license that regulates all artwork and video files I provide to the Internet Archive?"

Contract for New Questions:
**Contract for Contributing Visual and Audio Media**

To promote the sharing and accessibility of creative works, all users contributing visual and audio media to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public for re-distributing and re-using their contributions freely, provided that proper attribution is given and the same freedoms are granted to any derivative works.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

a. **Media to which you hold the copyright:** When you submit visual or audio media that you own, you agree to license it under:
   - Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), and
   - GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).
   (Re-users may comply with either license or both.)

The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any media you contribute under that particular license. For example, at the publication of this version of the Terms of Use, Wikimedia Commons mandates that all media content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License (CC BY 2.0) and does not require a dual license with GFDL.

Please note that these licenses allow for commercial uses of your media, as long as such uses comply with the terms.

b. **Attribution:** Attribution is a vital component of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due to creators like yourself. When you contribute visual or audio media, you agree to be attributed in any of the following manners:
   i. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page containing the media you contributed (since each page has a history that lists all authors and editors);
   ii. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and provides credit to the contributors similarly to the credit given on the Project website; or
   iii. Through a list of all contributors (but please note that any list of contributors may be filtered to exclude insignificant or irrelevant contributions).

c. **Importing media:** You may import visual or audio media that you have found elsewhere or co-created with others, but in such cases, you warrant that the media is available under terms compatible with the CC BY 4.0 license (or, as indicated above, another license when required by the Project edition or feature). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.

You agree that, if you import media under a CC BY license requiring attribution, you must appropriately credit the creator(s). Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history during import. There may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported media cannot be used due to attribution difficulties.

d. **Non-text media licensing:** Non-text media uploaded to the Projects will be available under various licenses that support the overall goal of allowing broad re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for those licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and you must also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you contribute.

e. **No revocation of license:** Except as accordance with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license granted under these Terms of Use for visual or audio media contributed to the Wikimedia Projects or features, even if you terminate usage of our services. 

f. **Public domain media:** Media in the public domain is welcome! However, you must confirm the public domain status of the media under the laws of the United States and any other applicable country laws concerning the specific Project edition. When you contribute public domain media, you warrant that the material is genuinely in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.

g. **Re-use and distribution:** Re-use of media content hosted by us is encouraged, but exceptions exist for media contributed under "fair use" or similar copyright exemptions. Any re-use must comply with the applicable license(s).

When you re-use or distribute visual or audio media developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the creators in any of the following manners:
i. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages you are re-using (since each page has a history that lists all authors and editors);
ii. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternate, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and provides credit to the creators similar to the credit given on the Project website; or
iii. Through a list of all creators (but be cautioned that any list of creators may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).

You acknowledge that modified or added content must be licensed under the same terms when altering any media sourced from a Project website, and proper attribution must be clearly indicated.

d. "Are there overarching terms that establish a specific license for all graphics shared on the Free Culture Platform?"

Contract Corresponding to New Questions:

**Contract for Videos on Wikidata:**

To encourage the contribution of multimedia content and provide clear guidelines for its use, all users submitting video content to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to reuse and redistribute their contributions freely, as long as proper attribution is provided. Users also agree that any derivative works created from their contributions should maintain the same freedom to reuse and redistribute.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

a. **Videos to which you hold the copyright:** When submitting videos that you own the copyright for, you agree to license them under:
   - Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0).
   - GNU General Public License (GPL) (unversioned).

(Users may comply with either license.)

The only exception applies if the Project edition specifies a different licensing requirement.

b. **Attribution:** When contributing video content, you agree to allow attribution via:
   i. A hyperlink (where feasible) to the page of the video you contributed.
   ii. A citation of authorship in an accessible format.

c. **Re-use of video content:** Users are welcome to reuse video materials available on the Projects if they adhere to the underlying licenses. Different licensing terms may apply in instances of "fair use."

d. **Modifications:** If modifications are made to videos sourced from Projects, the modified versions must also be licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 or other required licensing for specific projects.

e. **Public domain videos:** Contributions that are public domain must be confirmed under the applicable laws, and the appropriate labeling must be applied.

Feel free to reach out if you have any inquiries about these terms.

New Questions:
a. "Is there a commitment from the online gaming community to handle instances of cheating?"
b. "Does the social media platform ensure that it will deal with cases of harassment?"
c. "Is there an assurance from the e-commerce website to respond to reports of fraudulent transactions?"
d. "Does the blogging network guarantee that it will take action against plagiarism?"

Contracts Corresponding to New Questions:
a. Contract: The online gaming community has the primary responsibility for creating rules and enforcing guidelines to maintain fair play. While the platform administrators may seldom interfere in community matters regarding rule enforcement, they reserve the right, though not the obligation, to investigate reports of cheating that significantly disturb the gaming environment or jeopardize user safety. In such instances, the community members may take preventive measures against identified cheats. Users found violating these rules may have their access restricted or be banned from participating in the community.

b. Contract: The social media platform strives to foster a safe and inclusive environment for all users. In rare situations, when serious harassment cases arise, the platform maintains the authority to act decisively. This includes the ability to investigate user interactions and implement measures against users whose behaviors breach the community's guidelines. While the platform typically relies on the community to address such issues, it reserves the right to intervene if necessary, including disabling accounts of those who engage in harassment, while upholding the principle of allowing good faith criticism.

c. Contract: The e-commerce website emphasizes the importance of trust and security within its marketplace. Users are encouraged to report any fraudulent transactions, and the platform commits to investigating such incidents. In extraordinary circumstances, where significant fraud is detected, the website may take appropriate action, including disabling accounts related to fraudulent activities, and reporting to law enforcement authorities if required. Users engaging in fraud are subject to penalties outlined in the website's Terms of Service.

d. Contract: The blogging network is dedicated to maintaining intellectual integrity and original content creation. It has set policies to identify and mitigate plagiarism instances. In cases where users are reported for plagiaristic actions, the platform has the right, though not the obligation, to investigate these claims, take necessary actions, including warning or blocking accounts of repeat offenders, while respecting the rights to creative expression and good faith sharing of ideas.

c. "Will the gaming community take measures against players who cheat in the competition?"
d. "Does the blogging site promise to investigate allegations of copyright infringement made by its users?"

New Contract:
The online forum has the primary responsibility to create and enforce policies pertaining to user conduct. In exceptional circumstances, the forum may feel the need to intervene in user decisions regarding conduct enforcement. In such cases, the forum reserves the right, but is not obligated, to:
(a) Investigate user activity to determine whether violations of the Terms of Service, community policy, or other applicable laws have occurred;
(b) Detect, prevent, or address issues related to harassment, security, or respond to user support requests;
(c) Restrict access to any user who violates these Terms of Service;
(d) Ban any individual from participating or engaging on the platform due to actions that violate the Terms of Service;
(e) Take necessary legal action against users violating these Terms of Service.

In the interest of maintaining community safety, any individual whose access has been restricted is prohibited from creating or using another account unless explicit permission is granted. This includes actions benign in nature that align with good-faith criticism but do not violate these Terms of Service.

Community members are empowered to act within the framework of established policies, which may include warning, investigation, blocking, or banning users violating those policies. Users agree to comply with the decisions of dispute resolution bodies established for the community, which might result in sanctions as outlined in those policies.

Problematic users who have faced restrictions across various community aspects may face comprehensive bans. The enforcement of such bans will adhere to the community’s established policies and regulatory measures.
