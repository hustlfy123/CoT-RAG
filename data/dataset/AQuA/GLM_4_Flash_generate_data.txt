Original Question: "Three numbers are in the ratio 5 : 6 : 7. The sum of its longest and smallest numbers equals the sum of the third number and 54. Find the third number?"

New Questions:
a. "Two numbers are in the ratio 4 : 5 : 6. The sum of the smallest and largest numbers equals the sum of the middle number and 36. Determine the middle number."
Context: Two numbers are in the ratio 4 : 5 : 6, which means if the smallest number is 4x, the middle number is 5x, and the largest number is 6x. Given that the sum of the smallest and largest numbers is equal to the sum of the middle number and 36, we can find the value of x and subsequently the middle number.

b. "The ratio of three consecutive integers is 1 : 2 : 3. The sum of the first and third integers equals the sum of the second integer and 63. Calculate the second integer."
Context: Let the three consecutive integers be n, n+1, and n+2. Their ratio is 1 : 2 : 3, so we have n, 2n, and 3n. The sum of the first and third integers equals the sum of the second integer and 63, which leads to the equation n + (n + 2) = 2n + 63. We can solve for n and then find the second integer, which is 2n.

c. "Four numbers are in the ratio 2 : 3 : 4 : 5. The sum of the smallest and largest numbers equals the sum of the third number and 75. What is the value of the third number?"
Context: Let the four numbers be 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. The ratio is 2 : 3 : 4 : 5. According to the problem, the sum of the smallest and largest numbers is equal to the sum of the third number and 75, which translates to 2x + 5x = 4x + 75. We can solve for x to find the value of the third number, which is 4x.

d. "Five numbers are in the ratio 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 : 7. The sum of the second and fifth numbers equals the sum of the third number and 120. Determine the third number."
Context: Let the five numbers be 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, and 7x, with x being a common multiplier. The ratio of the numbers is 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 : 7. The problem states that the sum of the second and fifth numbers equals the sum of the third number and 120, so we have 4x + 7x = 5x + 120. Solving this equation will give us the value of x, and with it, we can determine the third number, which is 5x.
