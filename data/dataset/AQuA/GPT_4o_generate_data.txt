Original Question: If 73! has 16 zeroes at the end, how many zeroes will 80! have at the end?

New Questions:
a. If 45! has 9 zeroes at the end, how many zeroes will 60! have at the end?
   Context: "In the factorial of a number, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 10, which in turn is determined by the number of factors of 5. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and every even number contributes at least one factor of 2, the number of zeroes at the end of a factorial is determined by the number of factors of 5."

b. If 100! has 24 zeroes at the end, how many zeroes will 85! have at the end?
   Context: "The trailing zeroes in a factorial are produced by the factors of 10, which are the result of multiplying pairs of factors 2 and 5. Since 2 is more frequent than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n."

c. If 56! has 14 zeroes at the end, how many zeroes will 70! have at the end?
   Context: "When calculating the trailing zeroes of a factorial, one must consider the factors of 10 that are created by the product of 2 and 5. Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5, which can be found by dividing the number by 5 and summing the results of that division."

d. If 82! has 18 zeroes at the end, how many zeroes will 95! have at the end?
   Context: "The trailing zeroes of a factorial are due to the factors of 10, which are made from pairs of factors 2 and 5. Since there are plenty of factors of 2, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5, which can be calculated by counting the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., in the factorial."
